The AI connectome is a project to follow advances in human-centered AI, which is a field broadly interested in studying the impact of AI on society. The goal is to keep us updated about trends in AI.

By day, I am a freelance researcher & writer living in a suburb of Montreal. I spent 17 years working as an academic neuroscientist, and then decided that I couldn't record yet another neuron. And after a short stint working at an AI startup, I chose to start my own business, helping scientists and professionals translate complex technical concepts for wider audiences. My projects are research-focused and data-driven, to create credible stories about science and technologies. I am curious about all sorts of topics, but particularly enjoy connecting concepts from different fields. If this sounds interesting, please feel free to contact me to find out how we might work together!
